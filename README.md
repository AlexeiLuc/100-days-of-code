Hello World!
Here are the projects I did/I'm doing using Python throughout my beginner-to-advanced journey during the 100 Days of Code Challenge.
There will be 3 internal repositories.
A repo with beginner projects, just some basic projects to get the syntax and the way the programming language works.
A repo with intermediate projects. OOP, simple games and projects using external softwares.
A repo with advanced projects.
